# Open-Toolchain Tekton Catalog

Catalog of Tasks usable in [Continuous Delivery Tekton Pipelines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tekton-pipelines)

**If you want `v1alpha1` resources, you need to reference the [`tekton_pipeline0.10.1`](https://github.com/open-toolchain/tekton-catalog/releases/tag/tekton_pipeline0.10.1) tag (or
[`tekton_pipeline0.10.1_workspace`](https://github.com/open-toolchain/tekton-catalog/releases/tag/tekton_pipeline0.10.1_workspace) tag to have `v1alpha1` resources using workspaces).**

**Note**: 
- These tasks are usable with Continuous Delivery Tekton Pipeline Worker Agent (Tekton definition with apiVersion: v1beta1). These tasks have been updated  following migration path described in https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/v0.11.2/docs/migrating-v1alpha1-to-v1beta1.md

## Breaking Changes 

### when moving from tag "tekton_pipeline0.10.1"

- These tasks are using **kebab-case style for EVERY parameters names**. So parameter `pathToContext` (in previous versions of the tasks) has been renamed as `path-to-context`, parameter `clusterName` has been renamed to `cluster-name` and so on...
- `communication` folder has been renamed to `slack` folder
- Some tasks has been renamed to match the following name format `<category alias>-<task>` where category alias is depending on the folder containing the tasks:

  | Folder/Category | Category alias |
  |--------|----------------|
  | cloudfoundry | cf |
  | container-registry | icr |
  | devops-insights | doi |
  | git | git |
  | kubernetes-service | iks |
  | slack | slack |
  | toolchain | toolchain |

  The task new names are listed in the following table:

  | Folder | Old task name | New task name |
  |--------|---------------|---------------|
  | container-registry | containerize-task | icr-containerize |
  | container-registry | cr-build-task | icr-cr-build |
  | container-registry | execute-in-dind-task | icr-execute-in-dind |
  | container-registry | execute-in-dind-cluster-task | icr-execute-in-dind-cluster |
  | container-registry | vulnerability-advisor-task | icr-check-va-scan |
  | git | clone-repo-task | git-clone-repo |
  | git | set-commit-status | git-set-commit-status |
  | kubernetes-service | fetch-iks-cluster-config | iks-fetch-config |
  | kubernetes-service | kubernetes-contextual-execution | iks-contextual-execution |
  | slack | post-slack | slack-post-message |

- Tasks that use workspace(s) may have changed the expected workspace name. Here is the list of the breaking changes for the expected workspace name

  | Folder | Task | Old workspace name | New workspace name | Description |
  | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | 
  | container-registry | icr-containerize | workspace | source | A workspace containing the source (Dockerfile, Docker context) to create the image |
  | container-registry | icr-cr-build | workspace | source | A workspace containing the source (Dockerfile, Docker context) to create the image |
  | container-registry | icr-execute-in-dind | workspace | source | A workspace containing the source (Dockerfile, Docker context) to create the image |
  | container-registry | icr-execute-in-dind-cluster | workspace | source | A workspace containing the source (Dockerfile, Docker context) to create the image |
  | container-registry | icr-check-va-scan | workspace | artifacts | Workspace that may contain image information and will have the va report from the VA scan after this task exection |
  | git | git-clone-repo | workspace | output | Workspace where the git repository will be cloned into |
  | git | git-set-commit-status | workspace | artifacts | Workspace that may contain git repository information (ie build.properties). Should be marked as optional when Tekton will permit it |
  | kubernetes-service | iks-fetch-config | workspace | cluster-configuration | A workspace where the kubernetes cluster config is exported |
  | kubernetes-service | iks-contextual-execution | workspace | cluster-configuration | A workspace that contain the kubectl cluster config to be used |
  
### when moving from tag "tekton_pipeline0.10.1" and/or branch "tkn_v1beta1"

- Tasks that are expecting a secret to retrieve apikey and/or secret values have been updated to use the default secret `secure-properties` injected by Continuous Delivery Tekton Pipeline support. The updated tasks are:
  - icr-check-va-scan
  - icr-containerize
  - icr-cr-build
  - icr-execute-in-dind
  - icr-execute-in-dind-cluster
  - git-clone-repo
  - git-set-commit-status
  - iks-fetch-config

  Note: As a reminder, in previous version (before `secure-properties` injection by CD tekton support), the default was set to `cd-secret`
